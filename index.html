    <p>How to make an oragami crane.
    </br>
        Step 1: Using a square piece of paper, fold the paper in half to form a triangle. If using a piece of paper colored on one side only, begin with the colored side facing up. Unfold the paper and repeat to make folds.
    </br>
        Step 2:Flip the paper so the colored side is facing down and fold the paper in half forming a rectangle. Unfold the paper and repeat to make folds.
    </br>
        Step 3:Now fold along all four creases at once to form a square with the open end facing you.
    </br>
        Step 4:Fold two edges in, to form a kite-shape on top. Repeat on other side.
    </br>
        Step 5:Fold the point down and crease above the other two folds. Flip the paper and repeat fold. Undo the folds you made in steps 4 and 5.
    </br>
        Step 6:Pull the bottom corner (top layer only) up above the top corner. Fold along the creases you made in steps 4 and 5. Repeat on the other side.
    </br>
        Step 7:Fold two edges in to form a kite-shape. Repeat on the other side.
    </br>
        Step 8: Fold the top layer (right side) to lay on top of the left side like turning the page of a book. Flip over and repeat on the other side.
    </br>
        Step 9:Fold up the top layer as far as you can on each side.
    </br>
        Step 10: Fold the top layer (right side) to lay on top of the left side like turning the page of a book. Flip over and repeat on the other side.
    </br>
        Step 11:Fold down wings.
    </br>
        Step 12:Bend down the head to give the crane a long beak. Pull the wings straight out from the body so that the body inflates.
    </br>
        Now you have your own oragami crane.
    </br>
        Fun Fact: Did you know that in a Japanese legend if you fold 1,000 oragami cranes you will be granted 1 wish!
